# Hack Description – Global AI Hackathon (Sarajevo Chapter)

**description:**  
- this project highlights my practical experience in **digital forensics**, developed during my **CDFE certification**
- i worked on **three forensic cases**, where i investigated malware-infected computers and analyzing compromised systems


- the investigations included
  1. **malware analysis case** – examined an infected system to identify malicious files and understand the attack vector  
  2. **user activity investigation** – reconstructed user actions from system artifacts to uncover potential data breaches
  3. **incident response simulation** – conducted a full forensic workflow to analyze suspicious activity and preserve evidence

**tools & technologies:**  
- **Autopsy** – used it for file system analysis and timeline reconstruction
- **Volatility** – used for memory analysis to detect malware and suspicious processes  
- **FTK Imager** – used it for disk imaging and evidence preservation  
- **Python & Web Scraping** – used for supporting data analysis and reporting  
- **BeEF** – exploerd browser-based security vulnerabilities
